                            <B>Information and communications technology (ICT)</B> is an extensional term for
                            information
                            technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications and the integration of
                            telecommunications <I>(telephone lines and wireless signals)</I> and computers, as well as
                            necessary
                            enterprise software, middleware, storage and audiovisual systems, that enable users to
                            access,
                            store, transmit, and manipulate information. The term ICT is also used to refer to the
                            convergence
                            of audiovisual and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or
                            link
                            system.There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone network with the computer
                            network
                            system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management.ICT is
                            an
                            umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell
                            phones,
                            computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services
                            and
                            appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning. ICT is a broad

                            the concepts are evolving.It covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate,
                            transmit, or
                            receive information electronically in a digital form(e.g., personal computers, digital
                            television,
                            email, or robots).Theoretical differences between interpersonal - communication technologies

                            The phrase "information and communication technologies" has been used by academic
                            researchers since
                            the 1980 s. The abbreviation "ICT" became popular after it was used in a report to the UK
                            government
                            by Dennis Stevenson in 1997, and then in the revised National Curriculum for England, Wales
                            and
                            Northern Ireland in 2000. However, in 2012, the Royal Society recommended that the use of
                            the term
                            "ICT" should be discontinued in British schools "as it has attracted too many negative
                            connotations". From 2014 the National Curriculum has used the word computing, which reflects
                            the
                            addition of computer programming into the curriculum. Variations of the phrase have spread
                            worldwide.The United Nations has created a "United Nations Information and Communication
                            Technologies Task Force" and an internal "Office of Information and Communications
                            Technology"<br><br>

                            The money spent on IT worldwide has been estimated as US$3 .8 trillion in 2017 and has been
                            growing
                            at less than 5 % per year since 2009. The estimate 2018 growth of the entire ICT is 5 % .The
                            biggest
                            growth of 16 % is expected in the area of new technologies(IoT, Robotics, AR / VR, and AI).
                            The 2014
                            IT budget of the US federal government was nearly $82 billion. IT costs, as a percentage of
                            corporate revenue, have grown 50 % since 2002, putting a strain on IT budgets.When looking
                            at
                            current companies ' IT budgets, 75% are recurrent costs, used to "keep the lights on" in the
                            IT
                            department, and 25% are the cost of new initiatives for technology development.
